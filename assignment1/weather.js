// Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
// as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the
// temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

var currentTemp = 80;
condition=(currentTemp>30)?"Hot":"Moderate";
console.log("Weather condition is "+condition);
