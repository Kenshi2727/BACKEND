Q4. Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

Answer:
=======

Comma operator is used when we have to evaluate multiple expressions in javascript.
Remember that the last expression is excluded from evaluation.
We can use the comma operator when we want to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression.
We usually use comma operator(,) in for loop for giving multiple initializations and multiple updaters.
It has the lowest precedence of all operators so in a bigger expression it is suggested to paranthesize it.
It is also used for multiple assignments.

Example-
=======
let x = 8;

x = (x++, x--);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 9

x = (2, 3,8,9,1000000000);

console.log(x);
// Expected output: 1000000000



Syntax-
======
expr1, expr2, expr3/* , … */


Parameters-
==========
expr1, expr2, expr3, …
One or more expressions, the last of which is returned as the value of the compound expression.
